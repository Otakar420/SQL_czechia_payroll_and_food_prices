# SQL project

This project aims to assess the **availability of staple foods to the general public** by analysing relevant datasets. The aim is to answer defined **research questions** that relate to the comparison of food availability based on **average income** for specific **time periods**.

- **Average earnings in sectors:** Data for the period **2000-2021**.
- **Food category prices:** Data for the period **2006-2018**.

As additional material, I have also prepared a table with data on **GDP, GINI coefficient** and **population of other European countries** for the same period as the primary data for the Czech Republic.

## Research questions

1. Have wages been rising over the years in all sectors, or have they been falling in some sectors?
2. How many litres of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data?
3. Which food category is becoming more expensive at the slowest rate (has the lowest annual percentage increase)?
4. Is there a year in which the annual increase in food prices was significantly higher than the increase in wages (greater than 10%)?
5.  Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if GDP rises more significantly in one year, does this translate into a more significant rise in food prices or wages in the same or subsequent year?
